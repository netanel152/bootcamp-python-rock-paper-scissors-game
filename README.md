# Rock, Paper, Scissors ✊✋✌️

A simple, classic command-line game of Rock, Paper, Scissors written in Python. Play against the computer and see if you can win!

## Description

This project is a straightforward implementation of the classic game. The user is prompted to make a choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors), and the computer makes a random choice. The winner is then determined based on the standard rules of the game. The game uses fun ASCII art to visually represent the choices.

## Features

* **Classic Game Logic**: Rock crushes Scissors, Scissors cuts Paper, and Paper covers Rock.
* **ASCII Art**: Fun text-based art to display your choice and the computer's.
* **Random Opponent**: A randomized computer opponent for a new challenge every time.
* **Input Validation**: The game gracefully handles invalid user inputs.
